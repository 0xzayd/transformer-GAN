## 5 Difference from original paper
- GELU activation is only approximated through: <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0.5x(1%2Btanh[\sqrt{2/\pi}(x%2B0.044715x\^3)])"> to speed up computations done at GPU.

- MLP is formed by Fully Connected => GELU ==> Fully Connected => GELU
